# how to create a class

# "class ClassName:" is how to create a class
# can create an attribute through an object as well.
# we use constructors to create attributes to objects when being initialized.
# class ClassName: 
        # def __init__(self):
            # here you initialize the attributes to the class
# this init function is called everytime an object is created from the class.
# can use def __init__(self, parameter1, parameter2,....):
            # now you can use the parameters to initialize some default values to every object created from the class or allow attributes to be created at the time of object creation


# can also create methods in the class that can be used by every object henceforth.

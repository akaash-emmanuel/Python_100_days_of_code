# dictionaries and nesting
# dictionary has 2 parts: key and value, the key is basically the word of a real dictionary and the value is like the definition of the word
# dictionary = {key : value, key1 : value1, ...}  is how you would create a dictionary
# a good practice to create a dictionary is as follows:
# dictionary = {
#     key1 : value1,
#     key2 : value2,
#     key3 : value3,
#     .
#     .
#     .
#     .
# }

# dictionaries are identified by their key, i.e print(dictionary["key1"]), this retrieves the value associated with key1, using the correct datatype in the key area when calling a dictionary is very important
# to add entries or edit entries in an existing dictionary : dictionary["new_key"] = "new_value"
# to delete all entries in an existing dictionary : dictionary = {}, this removes all values and makes a clean slate
# to get the keys in the dictionary, running a for loop through the dictionary like its a list will work.

# nesting lists and dictionaries : these are flexible, i.e a dictionary can have a dictionary or a list inside and vice versa.

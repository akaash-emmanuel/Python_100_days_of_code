# debugging steps :   1. untangle the problem, i.e describe the problem
#                     2. reproduce the bug, i.e if a bug occurs a few times but doesn't usually, then try to make the bug happen to fix it
#                     3. play computer and evaluate each line
#                     4. use print() statement to fix the errors
#                     5. use a debugger

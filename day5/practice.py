# for loops
# for data in lists:  -> this is very similar to for(i = 0; i<= index_last; i++) in a list called lists.
# the variable name 'data' is given to each data in the list
# for n in range(0, last) is a basic syntax
# range(0, last) this will loop from 0 to last-1 always
# range(0, last, n) this will loop from 0 to last-1 with 'n' gaps in between: 0, 0+n, 0+2n, ...

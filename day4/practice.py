#randomisation and lists

#to use the random module we import a module called: import 'random' 
# can also import other files by importing. import 'file_name', this connects files together
# can use AskPython documentation to read about modules and what they offer in each module. 
# random.randint(a,b) = random integer between a and b
# random() = random float between 0.00000000  to 0.9999999
# .split(" ") = splits the strings separated by whatever is enclosed in the ""

# list = [datatype1, datatype2, datatype3, .....], they are stored in an order as stored in the list.
# lists can be accessed by accessing the index of the list, list[0] = datatype1 and so on
# list.append(new_datatype): adds a new data to the end of the list
# list.extend([newD1, newD2, newD3, ...]): this adds new list to the existing list
# len(list): returns the number of items in the list, storing this would create a list containing the numbers of the list, 1,2,3....
# can create nested lists: list = [list1, list2, ...]: list1 and list2 must be defined previously
# nested lists work like a 2d array
# list.index("data"): returns the index at which data is located in the list

# OOPS in python: 
# splitting a large problem into smaller problems and is worked upon individually, OOPs takes it further by allowing multiple features that simplify relationships in code
# it allows creation of objects that have certain set of attributes and a certain set of methods that are true to itself.
# objects are created from class

# from turtle import Turtle, Screen   # all functions about turtle graphics can be found in python libraries online
# timmy = Turtle()      # creating object called timmy that is made from Turtle() class
# print(timmy)
# timmy.shape("turtle")    # these are methods part of the turtle() class
# timmy.color("coral4")    # these are methods part of the turtle() class
# timmy.forward(100)       # these are methods part of the turtle() class
#
# my_screen = Screen()
# print(my_screen.canvheight)     # this too
# my_screen.exitonclick()   # these are methods part of the screen() class


# can use "pypi" that has packages made by other developers that can be imported into our code

# Steps : PyCharm -> Settings -> Project -> Python Interpreter -> + button and type package name and install
# Accessing Steps : from package_name import package_name_class

# read the documentation of the package to know what it provides and how to access it
